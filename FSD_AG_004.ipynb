        "- Agility and Iteration : The ability to easily create \"cheap\" branches allows for rapid experimentation and the development of multiple features in parallel.\n",
        "- Code Quality and Review : Platforms built on Git, like GitHub and GitLab, formalize collaboration through Pull Requests (or Merge Requests). These are mechanisms that require peer review of code changes before they are merged into the main codebase, which significantly improves code quality and knowledge sharing.\n",
