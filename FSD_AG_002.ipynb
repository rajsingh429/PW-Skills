        "Importance of Using Semantic HTML:\n",
        "- Accessibility: Semantic tags provide essential context for assistive technologies like screen readers.\n",
        "-  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) : Search engines like Google analyze the HTML structure of a page to understand its content and rank it in search results. Using semantic tags helps search engine crawlers correctly identify the important parts of your content.\n",
        "- Code Readability and Maintainability : Semantic HTML makes the code much easier for developers to read and understand. When you or another developer revisits the code, a well-structured document using tags like <section>, `<article>`, and `<aside>` is self-explanatory.\n",
